<align="center"><b><color=#FFD200><size="38">Welcome to the Cauldron!</size></color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>The Cauldron Daily Brew is an activity-based reward system that lets you receive shop items for free based on how often you log into the game. The Daily Brew awards daily merit points, with a larger prize awarded on the last day of the seven day brewing period. We've answered a number of questions that you may have about the Cauldron below.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>How Does The Cauldron Daily Brew Work?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>Every day that you log on to Traitors in Salem, you can visit the Cauldron by clicking the Daily Brew button in the Home navigation menu. When the Cauldron screen opens, a Witch awaits you behind her cauldron. The Witch gives you a free daily potion that you apply to the Cauldron brew, awarding you 20 Merit Points (or 40 MP for Steam linked or Web Premium accounts). Return each day to apply your free daily potion, and on the seventh day you will win a free random Prize which can include any item from the Shop minus certain exclusive items (such as Refer-a-Friend, SteamBot3000, Kickstarter award items, and Boat Load of Swag).</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>What Kind of Prizes Can The Cauldron Award?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>The Cauldron can award character skins, pets, houses, maps, lobby icons, scrolls, taunts, themes, death animations, and merit points. They are all potential prizes that can be awarded.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Can the Cauldron Award Town Point-Only Items?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>Yes, the Cauldon can award Town Point-only items!</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Do I Have To Visit the Cauldron Every Day to Retain My Progress?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>You do not have to visit every day. You will NOT lose your progress if you miss a day or multiple days. However, the days you do not apply your free daily potion will not count towards completing your seven day brew. Only the days that you visit the Cauldron and apply your potion count towards the completion of the seven day brew.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>How Often Can I Visit The Cauldron?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>The Cauldron has a 23 hour cooldown between free daily potions. The Daily Brew button at the top of the screen shows how much time remains before the next daily potion can be claimed.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Can I Specialize My Brew to Guarantee I Receive a Certain Type of Prize?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>Yes. If you choose to, you can specialize your brew by purchasing a potion using Town Points. The special potion enhances your Cauldron to ensure you receive a certain kind of prize on the seventh day. These specialization potions are optional. The specialization potions available are listed below.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%><b><color=#FFB84D>Character potion</color></b> - guarantees your prize will be a Character skin.</indent></align><align="left"><indent=3%><b><color=#FFB84D>Pet Potion</color></b> - guarantees your prize will be a Pet skin.</indent></align><align="left"><indent=3%><b><color=#FFB84D>Death Animation Potion</color></b> - guarantees your prize will be a Death Animation.</indent></align><align="left"><indent=3%><b><color=#FFB84D>House Potion</color></b> - guarantees your prize will be a House.</indent></align><align="left"><indent=3%><b><color=#FFB84D>Legendary Potion</color></b> - guarantees you a high value item from the shop (above 2,000TP) such as Uriel, Beelzebub, or Map Pack bundles! If you're awarded a bundle, the Cauldron will spew out multiple prizes!</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Does the Default Brew Contain Every Prize Available With the Specialization Potions?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>Yes, every item that is available via the specialization potions can also be received via the default brew, just with a lesser chance since the pool of available prizes is larger.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>Will The Cauldron Award Me a Prize That I Already Own?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>The Cauldron will not award items that you already own except for consumables such as scrolls and taunts.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>What If I Already Own All The Items in a Category?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>If you already own all items in a category (ex: death animations) then the Cauldron will not let you purchase the specialization potion for that item. If you buy a specialization potion, then subsequently purchase all the items in that category from the shop while the Cauldron is still brewing, then the Cauldron will award you an alternate prize.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align>]]>

SEE CHANGE LOG BELOW.

<b>4/22/2022</b>
Hey Townies, thank you for participating in our Traitors in Salem Early Access Beta. We are very pleased to open our game up to more players, and we look forward to any feedback you would like to provide to help us improve the game. During the Beta period, we will be periodically releasing bug fixes and new features. With each release, we will update the change log below accordingly.

As you might expect for a beta release, you may encounter some bugs here and there, and some things may not yet be at a completely polished finished state. When that happens, you can help by capturing the bug with as much detail as possible and reporting it in the official Traitors in Salem bug report forum (accessible via button click in the Settings popup in the game). This beta release also includes an automated bug reporting mechanism that does not require any user interaction to notify us of certain exceptions that may occur. By playing Traitors in Salem, you agree to allow the automated bug reporting system to submit bugs on your behalf. These autosubmitted bugs are crashes or unhandled exceptions, and usually won't be triggered by visual bugs or gameplay bugs, so your manual bug reports have great value.

We believe the game is fun and is ready to be shown off to the world. Feel free to post screenshots, stream the game, or make videos about it, while keeping in mind that the game is still in beta so make sure that your expectations are in the right place.

Thank you and happy hanging!
The BMG Dev team

XIV. EQUITABLE REMEDIES

You hereby acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames would suffer irreparable harm if this Agreement were not specifically enforced. Consequently, in addition to such monetary and other relief as may be recoverable at law, you agree that BlankMediaGames shall be entitled to specific performance or other injunctive relief, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, as remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Additionally, in the event any legal or administrative action or proceeding is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement and consistent with Section XV below, the    prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party as the result of the action or proceeding.
      
XV. NEGOTIATIONS, BINDING ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW

A. <u>Negotiations.</u> Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”), you and BlankMediaGames agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except those Claims expressly excluded in Section XV.F below). BlankMediaGames will send its notice to the address it has on file to the extent that you have provided additional contact information to BlankMediaGames (e.g. by participating in a promotion or survey, or contacting a customer services representative). Otherwise, BlankMediaGames will send its notice to the email address associated with your Account. You will send your notice to BlankMediaGames LLC, 9900 Spectrum Drive, Austin, TX 78717. Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.

B. <u>Binding Arbitration.</u> If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations, within such thirty (30)-day period, either you or BlankMediaGames may elect to have the Claim (except as otherwise provided in Section XV.F) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. Both the AAA Rules and the AAA Consumer Rules can be found at the AAA website, www.adr.org. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section XV.B and either the AAA Rules or the AAA Consumer Rules, the terms in this Section XV.B will control and prevail.

Except as otherwise set forth in Section XV.F, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and BlankMediaGames will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and BlankMediaGames may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.

BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND BlankMediaGames ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

C. <u>Arbitration Fees.</u> If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by the AAA Rules for initiating the arbitration. Your share of all other fees and costs of the arbitration, including your share of arbitrator compensation, will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules, and where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. Where your share of the costs is deemed to be excessive by the arbitrator, BlankMediaGames will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.

D. <u>Location.</u> The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify BlankMediaGames in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of BlankMediaGames’ arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Austin, Texas, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Austin, Texas, United States of America, and you and BlankMediaGames agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

E. <u>Limitations.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between BlankMediaGames and you individually. YOU AND BlankMediaGames AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.

F. <u>Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or BlankMediaGames’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.

G. <u>Governing Law.</u> Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the “Act”) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement.

H. <u>Severability.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that if any portion this Section XV is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section XV.F), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section XV.F is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor BlankMediaGames will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section XV.F found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Austin, State of Texas, United States of America, and you and BlankMediaGames agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.]]>
