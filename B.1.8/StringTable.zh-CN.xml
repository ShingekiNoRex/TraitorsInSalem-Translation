The Daily Brew awards daily merit points, with a larger prize awarded on the last day of the seven day brewing period. We've answered a number of questions that you may have about the Cauldron below.</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>How Does The Cauldron Daily Brew Work?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>Every day that you log on to Traitors in Salem, you can visit the Cauldron by clicking the Daily Brew button in the Home navigation menu. When the Cauldron screen opens, a Witch awaits you behind her cauldron. The Witch gives you a free daily potion that you apply to the Cauldron brew, awarding you 20 Merit Points (or 40 MP for Steam linked or Web Premium accounts). Return each day to apply your free daily potion, and on the seventh day you will win a free random Prize which can include any item from the Shop minus certain exclusive items (such as Refer-a-Friend, SteamBot3000, Kickstarter award items, and Boat Load of Swag).</indent></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><b><color=#FFD200>What Kind of Prizes Can The Cauldron Award?</color></b></align><align="left"><nobr></nobr></align><align="left"><indent=3%>The Cauldron can award character skins, pets, houses, maps, lobby icons, scrolls, taunts, themes, death animations, and merit points.

SEE CHANGE LOG BELOW.

<b>5/23/2022</b>
Hey Townies, thank you for participating in our Traitors in Salem Early Access Beta. During the Beta period, we will be periodically releasing bug fixes and new features. Today we are releasing the Beta 8 patch (see details in Change Log below).

As you might expect for a beta release, you may encounter some bugs here and there, and some things may not yet be at a completely polished finished state. When that happens, you can help by capturing the bug with as much detail as possible and reporting it in the official Traitors in Salem bug report forum (accessible via button click in the Settings popup in the game). This beta release also includes an automated bug reporting mechanism that does not require any user interaction to notify us of certain exceptions that may occur. By playing Traitors in Salem, you agree to allow the automated bug reporting system to submit bugs on your behalf. These autosubmitted bugs are crashes or unhandled exceptions, and usually won't be triggered by visual bugs or gameplay bugs, so your manual bug reports have great value.

We believe the game is fun and is ready to be shown off to the world. Feel free to post screenshots, stream the game, or make videos about it, while keeping in mind that the game is still in beta so make sure that your expectations are in the right place.

Thank you and happy hanging!
The BMG Dev team

You agree that you will not create any work of authorship based on the Properties except as expressly permitted by BlankMediaGames.Additionally, except as otherwise set forth in this Section IV.A, BlankMediaGames does not authorize you to make any use whatsoever of any BlankMediaGames trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, taglines, and/or trade dress (collectively, the "BlankMediaGames Marks") under any circumstances without a written license agreement. Any reproduction, redistribution, or modification of the Properties, or use of the Properties not in accordance with the EULA or this Agreement, is expressly prohibited by law and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties.

Except for the license expressly granted with the "fan kit," BlankMediaGames reserves all rights, title, and interest in BlankMediaGames Marks and all other intellectual property, and does not authorize you to display or use such in any manner, including but not limited to use on websites, on blogs, in forums, in signatures, on products, or in printed or electronic publications.

B. <u>Game Assets, Town Points and Virtual Items.</u> When using the Game, you may accumulate in-Game assets associated with your Account, including, without limitation, objects, artifacts, currency, items, equipment, and/or other value or status indicators (“Game Assets”) that reside on servers operated by BlankMediaGames as data. You acknowledge and agree that such Game Assets are accumulated as part of your Account and therefore you shall have no ownership or other property interest in any of those Game Assets. You further acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames has the right, but not the obligation, to delete, alter, move, remove, or transfer any and all Game Assets, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you. BlankMediaGames does not provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaims any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data residing on servers operated by BlankMediaGames, including without limitation the Game Assets associated with your Account.

If you have a valid, active Account, you may participate in our Town Points service offering, which is a redeemable point system that operates like virtual currency (“Town Points”) used to license certain Game Assets that can be used while playing the Game, including, without limitation, character “skins”, backgrounds, in-game houses and pets (“Virtual Items”). Town Points can be purchased online through the in-Game store. Town Points might also be provided to you by BlankMediaGames as part of a promotion, or through other means, such as completing certain achievements in the Game, or through BlankMediaGames sponsored contests or sweepstakes. You agree that you will be solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to the acquisition of, use of or access to Town Points. Town Points are sold or issued in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you purchase and where you are purchasing. As BlankMediaGames feels necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion, BlankMediaGames may limit the total amount of Town Points that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total Town Points that may be held in your Account in the aggregate. BlankMediaGames will notify you in the event that you near any such limit. Additionally, price and availability of Town Points and/or Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.

You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Town Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify BlankMediaGames immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Town Points balance. BlankMediaGames will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. BlankMediaGames will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.

YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE Town Points SYSTEM AND THE VIRTUAL ITEMS YOU ACQUIRE HAVE NO MONETARY VALUE AND CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR CASH. NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF Town Points OR FOR VIRTUAL ITEMS OBTAINED USING Town Points. Some Virtual Items you obtain may have expiration dates while others do not, and each Virtual Item you obtain using Town Points will be included in your Account until the earlier of that Virtual Item’s expiration date, or your Account’s expiration or termination date, or such date when BlankMediaGames ceases to offer or support the Game.

The sale or transfer of Virtual Items or Town Points between users may only be conducted via services approved of and provided by BlankMediaGames, if any, and BlankMediaGames may terminate any Account that acts in contravention of this prohibition.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF BlankMediaGames. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR Town Points THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR Town Points OR VIRTUAL ITEMS. FURTHERMORE, BlankMediaGames SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE DESTRUCTION, DELETION, MODIFICATION, IMPAIRMENT, “HACKING,” OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR Town Points, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DELETION OF GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR Town Points UPON THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT.

YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTING THE PROPERTIES TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION OF, USE OF, AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE PROPERTIES.

XIV. EQUITABLE REMEDIES

You hereby acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames would suffer irreparable harm if this Agreement were not specifically enforced. Consequently, in addition to such monetary and other relief as may be recoverable at law, you agree that BlankMediaGames shall be entitled to specific performance or other injunctive relief, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, as remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Additionally, in the event any legal or administrative action or proceeding is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement and consistent with Section XV below, the    prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party as the result of the action or proceeding.
      
XV. NEGOTIATIONS, BINDING ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW

A. <u>Negotiations.</u> Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”), you and BlankMediaGames agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except those Claims expressly excluded in Section XV.F below). BlankMediaGames will send its notice to the address it has on file to the extent that you have provided additional contact information to BlankMediaGames (e.g. by participating in a promotion or survey, or contacting a customer services representative). Otherwise, BlankMediaGames will send its notice to the email address associated with your Account. You will send your notice to BlankMediaGames LLC, 9900 Spectrum Drive, Austin, TX 78717. Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.

B. <u>Binding Arbitration.</u> If the parties fail to resolve a Claim through negotiations, within such thirty (30)-day period, either you or BlankMediaGames may elect to have the Claim (except as otherwise provided in Section XV.F) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”) that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. Both the AAA Rules and the AAA Consumer Rules can be found at the AAA website, www.adr.org. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section XV.B and either the AAA Rules or the AAA Consumer Rules, the terms in this Section XV.B will control and prevail.

Except as otherwise set forth in Section XV.F, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and BlankMediaGames will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and BlankMediaGames may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.

BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND BlankMediaGames ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

C. <u>Arbitration Fees.</u> If we are initiating arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by the AAA Rules for initiating the arbitration. Your share of all other fees and costs of the arbitration, including your share of arbitrator compensation, will be charged pursuant to the AAA Rules, and where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. Where your share of the costs is deemed to be excessive by the arbitrator, BlankMediaGames will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.

D. <u>Location.</u> The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify BlankMediaGames in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of BlankMediaGames’ arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Austin, Texas, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Austin, Texas, United States of America, and you and BlankMediaGames agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

E. <u>Limitations.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between BlankMediaGames and you individually. YOU AND BlankMediaGames AGREE THAT (A) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (C) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.

F. <u>Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or BlankMediaGames’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.

G. <u>Governing Law.</u> Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the “Act”) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement.

H. <u>Severability.</u> You and BlankMediaGames agree that if any portion this Section XV is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section XV.F), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section XV.F is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor BlankMediaGames will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section XV.F found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Austin, State of Texas, United States of America, and you and BlankMediaGames agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.]]>
